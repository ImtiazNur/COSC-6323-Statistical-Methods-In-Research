```{r setup}
data <- read.table("./Geese.txt", header=TRUE)
model <- lm(time~temp, data = data)

summary(model)
```

## 2. Computing the LM coefficients:
```{r q2}
coefs = coefficients(model)
coefs
```

## 3. Regression Equation:

## Time = coefs[1] + coefs[2] * Temp

Or

Time = -19.66676 + 1.68065 * Temp


## 4. The confidence interval for $\beta$ 1:
```{r q4}
#?confint
confint(model)
```

From the above result, we can be 95% confident about the slope of the regression line that it is
between 1.209 and 2.153 minutes for increase of temperature per degree.


## 5. Correlation check
```{r q5}
cor.test(data$temp, data$time)
```

Since p-value(1.653e-08) < 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. Hence, there is a significant relationship between the time and temperature.

# 1. Necessary Plots
```{r q1}
plot(model)
```
