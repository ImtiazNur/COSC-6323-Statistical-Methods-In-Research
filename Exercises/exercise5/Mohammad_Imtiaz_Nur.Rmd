```{r anova_test}
soilData <- read.csv("SiltDataset.csv")

#ANOVA test
siteFactor <- factor(soilData$site)
analysis <- aov(soilData$silt ~ siteFactor)
summary(analysis)

```

As the p-value (0.00293) is less than 0.05, the difference in means is statistically significant.Hence there is a difference in silt content among the soils from different sites.

```{r boxplot}
boxplot(soilData$silt~siteFactor,xlab="site",
        ylab="Silt",
        main="Boxplots of silt vs site variety")
means <- tapply(soilData$silt, siteFactor, mean)
points( means, pch=8, col="green")
```
